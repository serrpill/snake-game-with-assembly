🛠️ Development Process

This game is written in Assembly language and runs on EMU8086.

The game logic includes random food generation, snake movement, and collision detection.

📌 Future Improvements

🔹 A more detailed score system can be added.

🔹 Food can appear randomly at different locations on the screen.

🔹 Multiple levels with increasing difficulty can be introduced.

🔹 The snake's appearance can be customized based on player preference.

🔹 Should hitting the wall end the game instead of reducing health?

🔹 Should a time limit be added for food?

🔹 Should different game modes be introduced?
